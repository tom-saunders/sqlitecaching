# sqlitecaching
This repository is a collection of utilities for working with the
python [sqlite3](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html)
library. It has been heavily influenced by [sqlitedict](https://github.com/RaRe-Technologies/sqlitedict),
but explicitly does not target older versions of python.
